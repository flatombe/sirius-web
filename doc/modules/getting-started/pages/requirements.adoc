= Requirements

The requirements below are for running an off-the-shelf sample application made with Sirius Web. Developers should refer to the developer-specific requirements detailed in the xref:developer-guide:index.adoc[Developer Guide] instead.

* A modern web browser

TIP: Sirius Web currently has some known issues with Firefox. We recommend using a Chrome-based browser if needed.

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 17

TIP: If you do not already have a JRE installed on your system, we recommend getting started with one of the builds made available by https://adoptium.net/[Eclipse Adoptium].

* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker]

* The https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-sirius/packages?q=sirius-web-sample&tab=packages&q=+org.eclipse.sirius.sirius-web-sample-application[latest "fat JAR" of the Sirius Web sample application]. It contains the complete sample application and all its dependencies.
