= Data Model

The *Data Model* specifies the structure of the domain-specific data that a _{stddef}_ is made to handle.

Depending on your point of view, the _Data Model_ is conceptually similar to what you may already know as _Metamodel_, _Abstract Syntax_ or _Grammar_.


== Data Model Creation

{sw} provides a low-code approach to defining the data model of a _{stddef}_.


=== The Domain Definition DSL

#TODO: Explain what is the Domain Definition DSL, its concepts, and how to use it to define a data model for our studio definition. Also probably mention the expressivity limitations it comes with.#


== Data Model Reuse

It is also possible to reuse, totally or partially, an existing _Data Model_.

#TODO: Explain how we can also just re-use an existing data model for our new studio definition. I guess Sirius Web will show us all registered domains and we can reference them as we wish.#
