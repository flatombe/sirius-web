= Representation Descriptions

A *Representation Description* is a mapping between concepts of the _xref:maker-manual:studio-definition/data-model.adoc[Data Model]_ (e.g. the `name` attribute of type `Entity`) and standard elements from the UI (e.g. displayed as a label in a node of a `Diagram Representation`, and as an editable text field in a `Form Representation`).

In these descriptions, the element from the _Data Model_ is often called the *semantic element* while the element produced that _represents_ it is often called the *graphical element*.


== Default Descriptions

{sw} provides 5 types of ready-to-use representation descriptions.

=== Deck Description

A *xref:maker-manual:studio-definition/view-model/deck-description.adoc[Deck Description]* defines how the xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc[] creates xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc#_deck[Deck Representations].

[cols="1,2",frame=none,grid=none,border=none,stripe=none]
|===
a|In Deck Descriptions:

* Semantic elements are represented as lanes and cards.
* Lanes are vertical groupings of cards.

=== Diagram Description

A *xref:maker-manual:studio-definition/view-model/diagrams.adoc[Diagram Descriptions]* defines how the xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc[] creates xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc#_diagram[Diagram Representations].

[cols="1,2",frame=none,grid=none,border=none,stripe=none]
|===
a|In Diagram Descriptions:

* Semantic elements can be mapped to nodes and/or edges.
* Edges can also represent features between semantic elements.
* Nodes can be inside or on the border of other nodes.
* Nodes can use default shapes or rely on vector images, possibly animated.
* Use powerful ready-to-use layout algorithms.
* Edit the diagram through integrated palettes

=== Form Descriptions

A *xref:maker-manual:studio-definition/view-model/form-description.adoc[Form Description]* defines how the xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc[] creates xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc#_form[Form Representations].

#TODO: Insert example snapshot of a Form Representation.#

=== Gantt Descriptions

A *xref:maker-manual:studio-definition/view-model/gantt-description.adoc[Gantt Description]* defines how the xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc[] creates xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc#_gantt[Gantt Representations].

#TODO: Insert example snapshot of a Gantt Representation.#

=== Portal Descriptions

A *xref:maker-manual:studio-definition/view-model/portal-description.adoc[Portal Description]* defines how the xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc[] creates xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc#_portal[Portal Representations].

[cols="1,2",frame=none,grid=none,border=none,stripe=none]
|===
a|Portal Descriptions are a bit peculiar compared to other representation descriptions:

* There is only *one single reflective instance*, so _{stdmkrs}_ cannot create their own.
* This singleton instance may be activated by the administrator of the application.
* The _Studio Users_ may create a _Portal Representation_ and configure which other representations get embedded into it, and how they are layed out.
* Portal representations can be created for any semantic element.

=== xref:maker-manual:studio-definition/view-model/tree-description.adoc[]

A `Tree Description` defines how the xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc[] creates xref:user-manual:studio-runtime.adoc#_tree[Tree Representations].

#TODO: Insert example snapshot of a Tree Representation.#

== Custom Representation Descriptions

Depending on your custom studio, it is possible that a _{stddev}_ may have contributed a xref:developer-guide:reference-documentation/studio-development.adoc#_custom_representation_description_apis[Custom Representation Description]. In that case, the documentation provided by your studio should explain how the corresponding `Representation Description` works.
