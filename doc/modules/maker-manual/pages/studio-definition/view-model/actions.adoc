= Actions

In {sw}, when specifying a xref:maker-manual:studio-definition/view-model.adoc[View Model], we may need to be able to express the _behavior_ of *actions* which occur as part of the _Studio User_ interacting with a graphical representation.

include::maker-manual:studio-definition/view-model/actions/model-operations.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

The only action language supported by {sw} is the set of _Model Operations_.
