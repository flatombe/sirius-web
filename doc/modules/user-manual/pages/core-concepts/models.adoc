= Models

#TODO: Need to confirm the model/object terminology that Sirius Web ultimately wants to use.#

In {sw}, a _Model_ is a root element inside a _Project_ that contains semantic data.

It conforms to one of the contributed _xref:user-manual:studio-runtime/data-model.adoc[Data Models]_.

_Models_ may contain various _Objects_, as defined by the _Data Model_ to which it conforms.
