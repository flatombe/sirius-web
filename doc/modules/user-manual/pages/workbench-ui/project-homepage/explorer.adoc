= Explorer

The *Explorer* view is one of the views in the left sidebar of the generic workbench UI.

.The _{view-explorer}_ view

It represents and allows the edition, through a tree structure, of the contents of the project.

The root elements of the tree are the _Model_ of the project.
The children elements of a node are its children _Objects_, as defined by the _Data Model_ it conforms to, and the _Representations_ whose target is the node element.
_Representations_ are *always* _leaves_ of the tree.

Each node is represented by an *icon* and a *label*. These are provided by the _Data Model_ contributing the corresponding element.

=== Synchronization

image:Explorer_Synchronization.png["Synchronization Icon"](`Disable synchronization with representation`): Defines whether to synchronize this view with the latest selection or not. When activated, selecting elements in other UI components of the workbench may change the selection in this view, and possibly expand the tree as a result.


== Contextual Menus

Each element displayed in the tree has its own contextual menu `...`.

Depending on the nature of the node, different actions are available.

=== Model

== Keyboard Shortcuts

=== Search (Ctrl+F)

When an element from the *Explorer* view is selected and in focus, keyboard shortcut `CTRL+F` opens a text popup that can be used to search for elements whose labels matches the given text.

By default, the matching text among label elements is highlighted in the tree.

.The Search popup

IMPORTANT: The text matching is case-insensitive.

image:Explorer_Search_Filter.png["{view-explorer} Search Filter Action Icon"]: It is also possible to filter the tree based on the resulting matches. In that case, only the matching elements and all of their ancestors in the tree are displayed.
