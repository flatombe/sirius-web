= Data Model Contributions

#TODO: I think here we need to describe what is a data model (essentially a metamodel) and its impact on the runtime. We should list all the various contributions that a data model makes, that has an impact on the Generic Workbench UI (and cross-reference the corresponding section):#

* when a data model contributes stereotypes, they appear in the homepage
* when a data model contributes queries, they appear in the "Related Elements" tab
* etc...
